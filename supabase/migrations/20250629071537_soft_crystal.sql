/*
  # Clean All Data from Supabase Database
  
  This migration removes all existing data from the database while preserving:
  1. Database schema and structure
  2. Tables, indexes, and constraints
  3. Row Level Security policies
  4. Functions and triggers
  5. Default holidays for the current year
  
  What gets cleaned:
  - All employee records
  - All attendance records
  - All leave requests
  - All comp off requests
  - All notifications
  - All profile change requests
  - All documents
  - All user-created holidays (preserves default system holidays)
*/

-- Start transaction to ensure atomicity
BEGIN;

-- Disable triggers temporarily to avoid cascading issues
SET session_replication_role = replica;

-- Clean all user data in the correct order (respecting foreign key constraints)

-- 1. Clean notifications (references employees)
DELETE FROM notifications;

-- 2. Clean documents (references employees)
DELETE FROM documents;

-- 3. Clean profile change requests (references employees)
DELETE FROM profile_change_requests;

-- 4. Clean comp off requests (references employees)
DELETE FROM comp_off_requests;

-- 5. Clean leave requests (references employees)
DELETE FROM leave_requests;

-- 6. Clean attendance records (references employees)
DELETE FROM attendance_records;

-- 7. Clean user-created holidays (keep default system holidays)
DELETE FROM holidays WHERE created_by IS NOT NULL;

-- 8. Clean all employee records (this will also clean auth.users via CASCADE)
DELETE FROM employees;

-- Re-enable triggers
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- Reset all sequences to start from 1 (if any auto-incrementing fields exist)
-- Note: We're using UUIDs, so this is mainly for completeness

-- Verify the cleanup
